# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator
## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria
To complete the assignment, a button to generate password will alert user to enter length of characters between 8 and 128 characters. 

If user does not meet character length criteria, they will be prompted to try again.

The user is then presented with a series of prompts with password criteria which will include upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.

A password will generate once user confirms all alerts and prompts and a new password is diplayed in the window.
